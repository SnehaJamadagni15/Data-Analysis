# Earthquake Analysis Dashboard



![Earthquake Analysis Dashboard1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7320805f-23bc-4327-b648-52705d137fcb)



This dashboard provides a comprehensive visualization and analysis of global earthquake data from 1900 to 2014. It helps to understand earthquake patterns, magnitudes, depths, and geographical distribution.



## Dashboard Overview

The dashboard includes multiple visualizations and key metrics to summarize earthquake activity:

### **Top Summary Metrics**
- **Total Earthquakes:** 8,313 — Total number of recorded earthquakes in the selected period.
- **Average Depth:** 76.86 km — Average depth of earthquakes.
- **Average Nst:** 245.2 — Average number of seismic stations reporting the earthquake.
- **Average Rms:** 1.008 — Average root mean square of residuals.
- **Average Gap:** 30.42° — Average azimuthal gap between seismic stations.
- **Average Dmin:** 4.264 km — Average minimum distance from a seismic station.

### **Visual Components**

1. **Total Earthquakes by Type and Year**
   - Stacked area chart showing earthquakes per type across the years.
   - Highlights trends and patterns over time.

2. **Earthquake Details with Total Nst**
   - Table displaying:
     - Date
     - Place
     - Magnitude
     - Depth
   - Allows filtering by date range for detailed exploration.

3. **Relationship Between Depth and Magnitude**
   - Scatter plot showing correlation between depth (x-axis) and magnitude (y-axis).
   - Helps identify patterns between shallow and deep earthquakes.

4. **Total Earthquakes by Places**
   - Geographic heat map showing the distribution of earthquakes worldwide.
   - Circle size indicates the number of earthquakes per location.

5. **Depth Histogram**
   - Bar chart displaying frequency of earthquakes at different depth ranges.
   - Helps identify common earthquake depth zones.

6. **Total Earthquakes by Month and Type**
   - Stacked bar chart showing the number of earthquakes by month and type.
   - Highlights seasonal or monthly trends.
